# Statistics

1. vmstat stands for Virtual memory Statistics
    - reports on processes, memory usage, CPU activity, IO disk
    - vmstat 
    - vmstat 2 5 (Prints stats every 2 seconds, total 5 times) 
    - vmstat 2 5 -SM (showing memory in MB)

2. iostat stands for Input/Output Statistics
    - It reports
    - CPU Usage, Device IO, Partition/Disk throughtput and utilization
    - install: sudo apt install sysstat -y
    - iostat
    - iostat 2 5
    - iostat -c (CPU usage only)
    - iostat -d (device stat only)
    - iostat -x (Extended stat only)

3.  ps - process Status
    - displays infor about currently running process on your system
    - just like top and htop but shows snapshot at the momemnt (its not updating continously)

    - ps (check output)
    - ps aux (a for all users, u user/owner, x includes processes)
    - ps -u sonam (user wise)
    - ps -p 151 (process id)

4. Nice and Renice

    - nice is used to start a process with some specified priority
    - renice is used to change priority of existing process
    - each process has a nice value ranging from -20 to 19
    - -20 (Highest Priority), 19 (Lowest Priority)
    - By default when you start a new process its having nice value 0.
    - to check it use top command
    - if nice value is 0 then priority is 20, if the nice value is -1 then priority is 19.

    - Higher the value means having low priority.
    - requires root access to give negative priority

**Create Script**
    - mkdir developers
    - cd developers
    - nano myscript.sh (enter below code)
```bash
    echo "Start My SCript with Priority $(nice)"
    sleep 100 # just wait for 100 seconds
    echo "script Completed Successfully"
```
    - ctrl+o enter ctrl+x 

    - check the content: cat myscript.sh

- run script default: sh myscript.sh & (run in background)
- may be you can see the output to exit press crl+c
- check backgorund process: jobs -l
- still the process running check: top -p 1137 (process ID)
- you can see the priority is 20 and ni value is 0

- once the procee completed, ctrl+c
- now let's run with new priotity
- nice -n 10 sh myscript.sh & 
- ctrl+c check the process id and check priority value 
- you can check top -p pid (see priority 30 and nice value 10)

- update the priority using renice command
- sudo renice -10 process-id
- again check using top command the update priority
