# Top Command

- Table of Processes
- real time information of CPU
    1. CPU usage
    2. Memory usage
    3. Running Processes
    4. System Load and uptime

- like Task Manager of windows system

**Header (System Summary)**
- top 10:23:43 --> current Time
- up 5 min - System Uptime
- 0 users - Numbers of users logged In
- load average: 0.20, 0.15, 0.10 -> system load for last 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

*Task*

- total: total no of processes
- running: active processes
- Sleeping: Idel Process waiting for some events
- Stopped: Paused processes
- Zombie: Dead process waiting to cleaned up

- %Cpu(s):  0.1 us(User Space- application)
- 0.0 sy  (System Space - Kernel)
- 0.0 ni (User Processes with priority changes- nice value) 
- 99.9 id (Idel Time)
- 0.0 wa (Waiting for I/O)
- 0.0 hi (Hardware Inturrepts)
- 0.0 si (software Inturrepts)
- 0.0 st (steal time- CPU time taken by hypervisor in Virtual System)

1. Mem: Physical RAM
2. SWAP: Virtual Memory Usage

    - total (Talal Memory)
    - free (Unused memory)
    - used (Used Memory)
    - buff/cache - Memory used by kernel buffers and cache

*Process List*
- PID: process ID
- USER: Owner of Process
- PR: Priority
- NI: NIce value to calculate priority
- VIRT: Virtual Memory Used
- RES: Physical memory Used
- SHRL Shared Memory
- S: Process Status (R- running, S- Sleeping, Z-zombie, T- Stopped)  
- %CPU: CPU Usage of process  
- %MEM : Mmeory Usage     
- TIME+ : Total CPU time
- COMMAND: Name of the command/process

**Interact With Top Command**

- q: quit
- h: to see the help and press q to exit
- k: kill process, see the process Id that you want to kill and then type press enter 
     send the signal 15 to terminate and enter
- r (change renice value)
- P to sort CPU
- M to sort Memory
- T to short by time
- 1 (Show per-CPU usage like if 8 cors then you can see 0-7 CPU usage)

- use shift + E change memory units form KB,MB to GB
- Shift + R reverse sort order
- Shift + I to switch  between idle and active processes
- Shift + W to write current settings to some file by default

- if you run just top them to exit use q
- top -d 2 (refresh after 2 seconds)
- top -n 3 (run for 3 iteration)
- top -p pid (to get the details of specific process)
