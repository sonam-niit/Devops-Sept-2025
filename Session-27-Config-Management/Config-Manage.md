# Configuration Management

- its a process of handling changes systematically to ensure system integrety over a time.
- It involves maintainig consistency of system changes by tracking and controlling chnages in sw/hw/infra/network etc..

**Why?**

- I have created 1 Python Project and I wnat to deploy it over 10 servers
- Create 10 AWS Instance
- connect with each instance using ssh
- install python dependencies
- install git, clone repo, run project
- Repeat all steps to deploy on 10 servers

- This process is time consuming and error prune
- to solve this problem we can use Configuration Management.
